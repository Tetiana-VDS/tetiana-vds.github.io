        <h4>
            Heading Font: "Noto Serif", serif;
           
        </h4>
        <p>
            To my mind Noto Serif' Font will look visually nice, and will grab people attention as a Heading Font for
            the Weather Forecast Website as this. It is easy to read and it contrast very
            with the text font.
          
        </p>

        <h4>
            Paragraph Font: "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica, sans-serif.
    
        </h4>
        <p>
            For the main text Font I have chosen "Trebuchet MS", Helvetica as it is
            casual, readable and easy-comprehendible.
