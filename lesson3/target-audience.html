        <h2 class="title">Scenarios</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <h3>Farmer</h3>
                <p>Spring has started and a farmer is planning on planting different kinds of potatoes and some other
                    vegetables. He is going to sell them in the market. Though in a condition that weather temperature
                    will be
                    lower than -3 degrees Celsius. If the temperature will suddenly fall down the harvest will not bring
                    much
                    good.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Travelers </h3>
                <p>A group of young people are planning a trip to another country. They have no idea what the weather is
                    like over there, is it cold or worm, how humid and strong is the wind and what is the water
                    temperature
                    or precipitations. In order to be ready and to pick more weather stable days to travel. For all this
                    information they can monitor at the Hot&Cold Weather Center site. In addition, they might check the
                    latest news for the place they are going to visit.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Parents</h3>
                <p>
                    One family wants to go for a hike and do a picnic, the clouds seems to be coming and they are not
                    sure
                    if that is good time to go. They open the Weather Forecast and see that the humidity is very low, so
                    the
                    chance that the rain is going to come is just tiny.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Community Service Workers</h3>
                <p>A repairman has received a call to check and repair head-lights in one local street. He is going t
                    use
                    different electric and metal equipment, as well as ladder. That’s a high-risk job and he needs to be
                    sure the weather conditions will allow him to work. </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>Filmmakers</h3>
                <p>Let’s say there is movie filmed and one of the scenes is to be in rain or thunderstorm, filmmakers
                    want
                    it to be natural, so they constantly are checking the Weather Sites for an opportunity to get this
                    part
                    of movie done.</p>
