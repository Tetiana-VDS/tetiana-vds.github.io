            <h2>Bila Tserkva history</h2>
            <p>
                At the beginning of the 11th century, the nomadic raids on the southern outskirts of Kievan Rus
                intensified. In 1017,
                the Prince Yaroslav the Wise defeated the Pechenegs and forced them to move to the south. In 1032, to
                strengthen the
                southern borders along the Ros’ River, the construction of a system of guard fortresses began.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of such fortresses was named St. Georgiy on Ros or simply Georgiy (Yuryev) (in honor of the
                Christian name of
                Yaroslav the Wise). The heart of the new settlement was a mountain with a castle and a white-stone
                cathedral on it.
            </p>
            <p>
                The town was repeatedly attacked and destroyed by various nomads: Pechenegs, Polovtsy, Mongols. The last
                time Yuryev was
                devastated and burned by nomads in the 13th century. The only remaining building was a large dilapidated
                cathedral.
                Built of white stone, it served as a landmark among the local dense forests.
            </p>
            <p>
                Therefore, a new settlement, which rose from the ruins of Yuryev, was named Bila Tserkva meaning “White
                Church”. During
                the archaeological excavations conducted in the 20th century, the remains of the church were found on
                the Castle Hill.
